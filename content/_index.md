# Hi! {#hi}

I'm [Harsha](https://www.harshasomisetty.me), and these are a collection of notes I started taking since Sep 2021 for classes at Rutgers, and things I learn on my own.

[This explorable directory](/roam_directory) is an organized version of the notes

[This full index](/notes) is a full list of all the notes
