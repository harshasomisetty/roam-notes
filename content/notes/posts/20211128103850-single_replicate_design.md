## With only one unit in a treatment, we don't get any residual value {#with-only-one-unit-in-a-treatment-we-don-t-get-any-residual-value}


### So, we combine interaction effects into estimate of error {#so-we-combine-interaction-effects-into-estimate-of-error}


### Essentially, there is not enough data to proeprly study interaction as everything could come down to random {#essentially-there-is-not-enough-data-to-proeprly-study-interaction-as-everything-could-come-down-to-random}


#### Thus, only sources we consider are the main type of treatment {#thus-only-sources-we-consider-are-the-main-type-of-treatment}
