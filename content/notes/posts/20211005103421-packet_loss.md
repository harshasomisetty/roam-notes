## Definition {#definition}


### Information fails to reach destination {#information-fails-to-reach-destination}


### Flow Control Algorithms {#flow-control-algorithms}


#### \*stop and wait (send packet, wait for confirmatin) {#stop-and-wait--send-packet-wait-for-confirmatin}

<!--list-separator-->

-  \* very slow throughput (1 frame/ round trip), if too long, then throughput is 0


#### sliding window (send k packets, receive aknowledgement for n pakets, send next n packets). {#sliding-window--send-k-packets-receive-aknowledgement-for-n-pakets-send-next-n-packets--dot}

<!--list-separator-->

-  [ K frames / Bandwidth + proportinal delay] is time. now sending k/round trip

<!--list-separator-->

-  PACKET LOss:

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  GO back N: if packet lost, then receiver doesn't accept, evyerhting is sent again

        <!--list-separator-->

        -  less efficient (since successful packets are lost, but its good

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Selective repeat (buffers out of sequence packets, but keeps pointer at the last expected packet)

        <!--list-separator-->

        -  more complicated


### **Loss Characteristic** {#loss-characteristic}


#### Burst loss: if a packet is lost, then next p packets are also probably lost. (wireless links {#burst-loss-if-a-packet-is-lost-then-next-p-packets-are-also-probably-lost-dot-wireless-links}


#### Random Loss, anythign can be lost {#random-loss-anythign-can-be-lost}


## Understanding {#understanding}


### Each receiving unit has a "buffer" to store data before it is processed. But if too much data is sent at once, it can't get stored {#each-receiving-unit-has-a-buffer-to-store-data-before-it-is-processed-dot-but-if-too-much-data-is-sent-at-once-it-can-t-get-stored}
