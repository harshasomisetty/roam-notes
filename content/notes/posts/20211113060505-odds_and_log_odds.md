## Ratio of something happening to something not happening {#ratio-of-something-happening-to-something-not-happening}


### Very different from probability {#very-different-from-probability}


#### But can calc odds from probability by taking ratio of p of success / p of fail {#but-can-calc-odds-from-probability-by-taking-ratio-of-p-of-success-p-of-fail}

\begin{align\*}
\frac{p}{1-p}
\end{align\*}


## Odds for winning team ranges from 1 to infinity, which makes comparing odds difficult {#odds-for-winning-team-ranges-from-1-to-infinity-which-makes-comparing-odds-difficult}


### EX: say you have 6:1 odds of winning, odds are 6. but other person has 1:6 odds of winning, which is .17 {#ex-say-you-have-6-1-odds-of-winning-odds-are-6-dot-but-other-person-has-1-6-odds-of-winning-which-is-dot-17}


### so, we take log of both odds, and can better compare {#so-we-take-log-of-both-odds-and-can-better-compare}


#### Log(1/6) = -1.7, log(6/1) = 1/7 {#log--1-6--1-dot-7-log--6-1--1-7}
