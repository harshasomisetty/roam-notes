## Want flexibility in assigning memory {#want-flexibility-in-assigning-memory}


## Have base &amp; bounds pair per lgoical segment of address space {#have-base-and-bounds-pair-per-lgoical-segment-of-address-space}


### Can break the 3 segments of a process (code, stack, heap), and place into memory independently {#can-break-the-3-segments-of-a-process--code-stack-heap--and-place-into-memory-independently}


### the [MMU]({{< relref "20211101144512-memory_management_unit.md" >}}) keeps track of thesepairs, along with write&amp;read permissions, grow direction bit, {#the-mmu--20211101144512-memory-management-unit-dot-md--keeps-track-of-thesepairs-along-with-write-and-read-permissions-grow-direction-bit}


### Ways of allocating segments {#ways-of-allocating-segments}


#### best fit: puts segment in closest fit hole {#best-fit-puts-segment-in-closest-fit-hole}


#### worst fit: puts segment in worst fit hole {#worst-fit-puts-segment-in-worst-fit-hole}


#### first-fit: puts segment in first available good hole {#first-fit-puts-segment-in-first-available-good-hole}


## But, this causes external fragmentation, when memory is not accessable between the segments {#but-this-causes-external-fragmentation-when-memory-is-not-accessable-between-the-segments}
