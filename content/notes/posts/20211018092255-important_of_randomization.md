## Randomization happens if the methods for assigning a unit to a treatment is probabilistic {#randomization-happens-if-the-methods-for-assigning-a-unit-to-a-treatment-is-probabilistic}


### By randomizing units in treatment groups, we can make assumptions like the units follow a normla distribution (mean &mu;, var &sigma;^2) for t and F tests etc {#by-randomizing-units-in-treatment-groups-we-can-make-assumptions-like-the-units-follow-a-normla-distribution--mean-and-mu-var-and-sigma-2--for-t-and-f-tests-etc}


#### Relies only on randomization, and not on independence, normality, and other linear model assumptions {#relies-only-on-randomization-and-not-on-independence-normality-and-other-linear-model-assumptions}


#### HOWEVER, randomization can be difficult to implement {#however-randomization-can-be-difficult-to-implement}


#### known as **Assignment Mechanism** {#known-as-assignment-mechanism}


## _Completely randomized treatment assignment_  randomly assign N_0 to control, and N- N_0 to treatment, \\(N \choose N\_0\\) number of randomizations ( can flip a coin for every unit (but every unit might be assigned to just 1 treatment) ) {#completely-randomized-treatment-assignment-randomly-assign-n-0-to-control-and-n-n-0-to-treatment-n-choose-n-0-number-of-randomizations--can-flip-a-coin-for-every-unit-but-every-unit-might-be-assigned-to-just-1-treatment}


### _Randomization_ important to eliminate _confounding_  from latent variables, reduces _bias_, ensures _statistical validity_. _Unbiased estimator_ for true treatment effect {#randomization-important-to-eliminate-confounding-from-latent-variables-reduces-bias-ensures-statistical-validity-dot-unbiased-estimator-for-true-treatment-effect}


#### without randomization, would be observational, and would need extra work to be made statistically accurate {#without-randomization-would-be-observational-and-would-need-extra-work-to-be-made-statistically-accurate}


### if N_0 = N_1, then design is completely _balanced_ {#if-n-0-n-1-then-design-is-completely-balanced}

isolating just the impact the treatment has on the outcome, thats why we do ranomization
