## _Treatment Factors_ {#treatment-factors}


### inputs into an experiment that are modified to see results, basically independent variables. {#inputs-into-an-experiment-that-are-modified-to-see-results-basically-independent-variables-dot}


### **Factors** are the things that are changed, **Levels** are the settings of each factor {#factors-are-the-things-that-are-changed-levels-are-the-settings-of-each-factor}


### Active level (new thing) is the treatment, passive level is the control level {#active-level--new-thing--is-the-treatment-passive-level-is-the-control-level}


#### Levels can be quali or quanti (discrete vs continuous), and screening experiments finds more useful factors {#levels-can-be-quali-or-quanti--discrete-vs-continuous--and-screening-experiments-finds-more-useful-factors}


## Nuisance (noise) factors {#nuisance--noise--factors}


### uncontrollable factor that causes variability in normal conditions. In labs, can be blocked or randomized {#uncontrollable-factor-that-causes-variability-in-normal-conditions-dot-in-labs-can-be-blocked-or-randomized}


### nuisance has some effect on the response, but is not of interest, and it's effect on the response needs to be explained or minimized {#nuisance-has-some-effect-on-the-response-but-is-not-of-interest-and-it-s-effect-on-the-response-needs-to-be-explained-or-minimized}


#### ex: batches of raw materials, different operators (diff nurses or teachers), pieces of test equipment, time {#ex-batches-of-raw-materials-different-operators--diff-nurses-or-teachers--pieces-of-test-equipment-time}


## Covariates {#covariates}


### Also noise, but can be measured to before experiment, and this can be used to adjust responses so that that factor doesn't affect experiment anymore {#also-noise-but-can-be-measured-to-before-experiment-and-this-can-be-used-to-adjust-responses-so-that-that-factor-doesn-t-affect-experiment-anymore}


## deal with: {#deal-with}


### block known and controllable nuisance {#block-known-and-controllable-nuisance}


#### Blocking is good so that the units in a block cancel out differences due to uninteresting factor {#blocking-is-good-so-that-the-units-in-a-block-cancel-out-differences-due-to-uninteresting-factor}

<!--list-separator-->

-  then, comparisons between blocks can be made more precise compared to unblocked

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  by blocking you get rid of latent differences i units, and yo compare a more purer version of just the effect
