## Several applications are run in parallel on two or more threads under the same core (Advances in financial machine learning) {#several-applications-are-run-in-parallel-on-two-or-more-threads-under-the-same-core--advances-in-financial-machine-learning}


### Because the applications are in the same core, they share the same memory space {#because-the-applications-are-in-the-same-core-they-share-the-same-memory-space}


#### This could lead to overwriting, but there is a Global Interpreter Lock so that [Critical Section Problem]({{< relref "20211011095015-critical_section_problem.md" >}}) is avoided. {#this-could-lead-to-overwriting-but-there-is-a-global-interpreter-lock-so-that-critical-section-problem--20211011095015-critical-section-problem-dot-md--is-avoided-dot}

-  In Python, multithreading is limited to one thread per processor (so parallelism is actually multiprocessing and not threading)


### Process can have multiple threads, multi-threaded process shared the code, data, and files, each child thread gets its own registers &amp; stack {#process-can-have-multiple-threads-multi-threaded-process-shared-the-code-data-and-files-each-child-thread-gets-its-own-registers-and-stack}


### Benefits: {#benefits}


#### Responsiveness: if parts of programs get slow, then the other threads can still run {#responsiveness-if-parts-of-programs-get-slow-then-the-other-threads-can-still-run}


#### Resource sharing: you don't need to use up memory and run the same program multiple times {#resource-sharing-you-don-t-need-to-use-up-memory-and-run-the-same-program-multiple-times}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Economy: Eaiser to context switch threads, and less overhead so less memory needs to be assigned


#### Multiprocessor Architecture: if you can split up process into multiple threads, each thread can run on different processors, so concurrent execution and faster {#multiprocessor-architecture-if-you-can-split-up-process-into-multiple-threads-each-thread-can-run-on-different-processors-so-concurrent-execution-and-faster}
