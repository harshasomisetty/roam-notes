## Hardware Solution to synchronization through a shared binary "lock" value {#hardware-solution-to-synchronization-through-a-shared-binary-lock-value}


### for a process to enter critical section, it will see if the lock is locked, wait until it unlocks, then enters critical section {#for-a-process-to-enter-critical-section-it-will-see-if-the-lock-is-locked-wait-until-it-unlocks-then-enters-critical-section}


### The central atomic operation is {#the-central-atomic-operation-is}

```C
boolean TestandSet(boolean *target){
  boolean rv = *target;
  *target = True;
  retrun rv;
```

Whats happening is, the test always locks the variable, and returns what the previous value was. if the value was already locked, no worries nothing changes. but if the variable was not locked, then now the critical section can be entered, and then aftr it can be unlocked again and gg


### Does satisfy mutual exclusion, but doesn't satisfy bounding, since one process might never get to execute secton {#does-satisfy-mutual-exclusion-but-doesn-t-satisfy-bounding-since-one-process-might-never-get-to-execute-secton}
