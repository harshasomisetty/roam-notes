-  They configure a subnet mask for their overall network, (stored in the routers)


#### For 4 subnets, the subnet mask will be 255:255:255:192 (need 2 bits from the {#for-4-subnets-the-subnet-mask-will-be-255-255-255-192-need-2-bits-from-the}


### Overall, at internet level, core routers care about network id (send data-gram to appropriate gateway router) {#overall-at-internet-level-core-routers-care-about-network-id--send-data-gram-to-appropriate-gateway-router}


#### gateway sends to destination machine, {#gateway-sends-to-destination-machine}


#### host machine uses host id to send to correct final machine {#host-machine-uses-host-id-to-send-to-correct-final-machine}

An IP address has a network address and host address. The network address is the highest port already configured, the host address is all the ports they can work with.
The host address can then be split with subnet masks

[Classless Interdomain Routing]({{< relref "20211102114100-classless_interdomain_routing.md" >}}) is easier way to signify subnet
