## "Factor" level combinations where g treatments are combinations of levels of each factor {#factor-level-combinations-where-g-treatments-are-combinations-of-levels-of-each-factor}


### notation is y<sub>ijk</sub>, ith level of factor A, jth level of factor b, and kth unit in that treatment {#notation-is-y-ith-level-of-factor-a-jth-level-of-factor-b-and-kth-unit-in-that-treatment}


## To analyze the data, we use factorial analysis, where we look at results in [Main Effects]({{< relref "20211115103733-main_effects.md" >}}) and [Interaction Effect]({{< relref "20211115103820-interaction_effect.md" >}}) {#to-analyze-the-data-we-use-factorial-analysis-where-we-look-at-results-in-main-effects--20211115103733-main-effects-dot-md--and-interaction-effect--20211115103820-interaction-effect-dot-md}


## We use [Contrasts]({{< relref "202110151506490-contrasts.md" >}}) to measure difference effects and answer difference questiosn {#we-use-contrasts--202110151506490-contrasts-dot-md--to-measure-difference-effects-and-answer-difference-questiosn}


## Variations {#variations}


### Some times, there isn't much interaction effect (except for One-cell interactions), so we use non-factorial to analyze {#some-times-there-isn-t-much-interaction-effect--except-for-one-cell-interactions--so-we-use-non-factorial-to-analyze}


### With only one unit in a treatment, we have to do [Single Replicate Design]({{< relref "20211128103850-single_replicate_design.md" >}}) {#with-only-one-unit-in-a-treatment-we-have-to-do-single-replicate-design--20211128103850-single-replicate-design-dot-md}


### If we want to predict covariance amoung factors, we use [Higher Order Factor Model]({{< relref "20211128105224-higher_order_factor_model.md" >}}) {#if-we-want-to-predict-covariance-amoung-factors-we-use-higher-order-factor-model--20211128105224-higher-order-factor-model-dot-md}


### need to use difference sums of squares for [Unbalanced Factorial Design]({{< relref "20211128114523-unbalanced_factorial_design.md" >}}) {#need-to-use-difference-sums-of-squares-for-unbalanced-factorial-design--20211128114523-unbalanced-factorial-design-dot-md}
