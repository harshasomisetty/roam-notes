## Models to estimate and analyze the differences among means. {#models-to-estimate-and-analyze-the-differences-among-means-dot}


### in a full group, the variance is partitioned into different sources of variation {#in-a-full-group-the-variance-is-partitioned-into-different-sources-of-variation}


#### in these partitions, we use ANOVA to test if 2 means are significant different by comparing those means and sub variations {#in-these-partitions-we-use-anova-to-test-if-2-means-are-significant-different-by-comparing-those-means-and-sub-variations}


#### The null hypothesis is that, all the levels caused by the independent variable are the same {#the-null-hypothesis-is-that-all-the-levels-caused-by-the-independent-variable-are-the-same}

<!--list-separator-->

-  if the means are significantly different, we know that some levels are actually different


## The number of independent RVs affects {#the-number-of-independent-rvs-affects}


### One way: One independent variable (just brand of cereal for ex) {#one-way-one-independent-variable--just-brand-of-cereal-for-ex}


### Two way: 2 independent variables (brand of cereal AND calories) {#two-way-2-independent-variables--brand-of-cereal-and-calories}


#### With replication: 2 unassociated groups {#with-replication-2-unassociated-groups}


#### without replication: double testing a group before and after {#without-replication-double-testing-a-group-before-and-after}
