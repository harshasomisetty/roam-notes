## Assumptions {#assumptions}


### Normality, the data is noramlly distributed (since this affects the results) {#normality-the-data-is-noramlly-distributed--since-this-affects-the-results}


#### Our estimations are normally distributed, ties into central limit theorm?? {#our-estimations-are-normally-distributed-ties-into-central-limit-theorm}


#### here, iits not just e=means, but we are saying even stronger that the results themselves are normally distributed {#here-iits-not-just-e-means-but-we-are-saying-even-stronger-that-the-results-themselves-are-normally-distributed}


### Independence, the error of each unit outcome is independent of other units {#independence-the-error-of-each-unit-outcome-is-independent-of-other-units}


#### different from SUTVA (my assignment should'nt affect outcome) (instead that there is no hidden correlation) {#different-from-sutva--my-assignment-should-nt-affect-outcome----instead-that-there-is-no-hidden-correlation}


### Equal variance {#equal-variance}


#### all have the same sigma^2, (in rnadomization, if all have same treatment effect, then all the variances are actually equal, but ow we actually just assume it to begin with) {#all-have-the-same-sigma-2--in-rnadomization-if-all-have-same-treatment-effect-then-all-the-variances-are-actually-equal-but-ow-we-actually-just-assume-it-to-begin-with}
