## We assume a factor has infinite levels, and that an experiment only has a small subset of all the levels {#we-assume-a-factor-has-infinite-levels-and-that-an-experiment-only-has-a-small-subset-of-all-the-levels}


### the effects of the levels are rvs, and we see if the effect is statistically significant {#the-effects-of-the-levels-are-rvs-and-we-see-if-the-effect-is-statistically-significant}


#### we usually try to see if variance is near 0 {#we-usually-try-to-see-if-variance-is-near-0}


### if experiment is repeated, would be different levels {#if-experiment-is-repeated-would-be-different-levels}
