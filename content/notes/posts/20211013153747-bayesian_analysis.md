## The idea is to update previous belief by combining with new data, and getting a new belief {#the-idea-is-to-update-previous-belief-by-combining-with-new-data-and-getting-a-new-belief}


### the previous belief is Prior distribution {#the-previous-belief-is-prior-distribution}


### data is likelihood function of what reality is from the sample {#data-is-likelihood-function-of-what-reality-is-from-the-sample}


### New belief is the posterior distribution {#new-belief-is-the-posterior-distribution}


## When the prior and liklihood are both normal, its easy, but otherwise, you can use [Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulation]({{< relref "20211013203955-markov_chain_monte_carlo_simulation.md" >}}) {#when-the-prior-and-liklihood-are-both-normal-its-easy-but-otherwise-you-can-use-markov-chain-monte-carlo-simulation--20211013203955-markov-chain-monte-carlo-simulation-dot-md}


## Example {#example}


### Want to rank basketball Teams at the start of a season {#want-to-rank-basketball-teams-at-the-start-of-a-season}


#### Prior: Start with a uniform ranking {#prior-start-with-a-uniform-ranking}


#### Data: [MCMC]({{< relref "20211013203955-markov_chain_monte_carlo_simulation.md" >}}), where you say that some teams are better than others (different tiers based on player skills), and simulate data saying that some ranking beat others {#data-mcmc--20211013203955-markov-chain-monte-carlo-simulation-dot-md--where-you-say-that-some-teams-are-better-than-others--different-tiers-based-on-player-skills--and-simulate-data-saying-that-some-ranking-beat-others}
