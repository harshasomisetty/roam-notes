## _Potential Outcome_ comparison of casual effect of Treat 0 vs 1. specifically, Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) {#potential-outcome-comparison-of-casual-effect-of-treat-0-vs-1-dot-specifically-y-i--1--y-i--0}


### But, only 1 of the outcomes for a unit can be observed, so unit-level causal effects can't be seen. Can estimate, but not as precise {#but-only-1-of-the-outcomes-for-a-unit-can-be-observed-so-unit-level-causal-effects-can-t-be-seen-dot-can-estimate-but-not-as-precise}


### Instead, you do \\(\bar{\tao} = \overline{Y(1) } - \overline{Y(0)}\\) ,  or can do other summaries (diff of medians), or don't even focus on casual effects {#instead-you-do-bar-tao-overline-y--1--overline-y--0--or-can-do-other-summaries--diff-of-medians--or-don-t-even-focus-on-casual-effects}


#### to genearlize to populations, need info on survey methods for external validity, which you already learned {#to-genearlize-to-populations-need-info-on-survey-methods-for-external-validity-which-you-already-learned}
