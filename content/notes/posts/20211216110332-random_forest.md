## Ensemble of multiple [Decision Tree]({{< relref "20211216110124-decision_tree.md" >}}) to reduce variance {#ensemble-of-multiple-decision-tree--20211216110124-decision-tree-dot-md--to-reduce-variance}


## To choose number of Trees, just choose large number {#to-choose-number-of-trees-just-choose-large-number}


### Each tree is IID since trees are frown from bootstrap randomization {#each-tree-is-iid-since-trees-are-frown-from-bootstrap-randomization}
