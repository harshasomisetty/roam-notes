### Strong law of large numbers {#strong-law-of-large-numbers}

<!--list-separator-->

-  if X_1, ... , X_n are iid rv with finite mean &mu;, then lim<sub>x&rarr; &infin;</sub> \\(\bar{x}\\) = &mu; with probability 1

<!--list-separator-->

-  NOT THE SAME as LLN (chebyshev)

<!--list-separator-->

-  LLN also works for sample means of kth power of rvs, denoted at M_k' (sample mean of kth power), lim<sub>x&rarr; &infin;</sub> = &mu;_k'
