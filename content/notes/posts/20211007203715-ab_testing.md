## Definition {#definition}

A way to compare two versions to see which performs better


## Process {#process}


### First Decide on what you want to test {#first-decide-on-what-you-want-to-test}


### Then decide on evaluation metrics {#then-decide-on-evaluation-metrics}


### get 2 sets of users {#get-2-sets-of-users}


#### need to randomize testing groups so random factors don't affect result {#need-to-randomize-testing-groups-so-random-factors-don-t-affect-result}


#### can do multivariate A/B testing incase you want more combinations. (only do with iwth substantial traffic for meaningful results) {#can-do-multivariate-a-b-testing-incase-you-want-more-combinations-dot--only-do-with-iwth-substantial-traffic-for-meaningful-results}


### Interpretation {#interpretation}


#### Track # of people who saw each treatment, and then track conversion rate {#track-of-people-who-saw-each-treatment-and-then-track-conversion-rate}

<!--list-separator-->

-  report would have the actual conversion rate, and a confidence interval


### Mistakes {#mistakes}


#### tests aren't run to completion, which breaks the randomization assumption and you don't get real results {#tests-aren-t-run-to-completion-which-breaks-the-randomization-assumption-and-you-don-t-get-real-results}


#### if you consider too many metrics, you are basically [Multiple Testing]({{< relref "20211007212319-multiple_testing.md" >}}) and can draw wrong conclusions {#if-you-consider-too-many-metrics-you-are-basically-multiple-testing--20211007212319-multiple-testing-dot-md--and-can-draw-wrong-conclusions}


#### Not retesting, since False Positives can occur {#not-retesting-since-false-positives-can-occur}

<!--list-separator-->

-  smaller the improvement, the less reliable the results
