## Basis of multiprogrammed OS: computer is more productive {#basis-of-multiprogrammed-os-computer-is-more-productive}


### Goal is to always have a process running {#goal-is-to-always-have-a-process-running}


### several processes are kept in memory, and so when a process has to wait, cpu starts to work on a different process {#several-processes-are-kept-in-memory-and-so-when-a-process-has-to-wait-cpu-starts-to-work-on-a-different-process}


#### New processes are constantly accessed through [System Interrupts]({{< relref "20211009164520-system_interrupts.md" >}}) {#new-processes-are-constantly-accessed-through-system-interrupts--20211009164520-system-interrupts-dot-md}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Here context switching happens, where new info needs to be loaded


### need to know which process is most important, etc. This depends on which algo you use {#need-to-know-which-process-is-most-important-etc-dot-this-depends-on-which-algo-you-use}


### The Programs are split into  whose instructions are stored in primary memory {#the-programs-are-split-into-whose-instructions-are-stored-in-primary-memory}


### On startup, processor executes instructions on permanent memory (booting), to see what devices are attached, and then starts process synchronization {#on-startup-processor-executes-instructions-on-permanent-memory--booting--to-see-what-devices-are-attached-and-then-starts-process-synchronization}


## CPU and I/O Bursts {#cpu-and-i-o-bursts}


### state of process, either doing cpu or waitig for io {#state-of-process-either-doing-cpu-or-waitig-for-io}


### final cpu burst terminates process {#final-cpu-burst-terminates-process}


## [Kernal]({{< relref "20211014214003-kernal.md" >}}) manages all the different processes {#kernal--20211014214003-kernal-dot-md--manages-all-the-different-processes}


### Sys callcs {#sys-callcs}


### interrupts, exceptions {#interrupts-exceptions}


### os modes {#os-modes}


#### Kernals, user {#kernals-user}


### Process management, fork, exec; Threads user level vs kernel level {#process-management-fork-exec-threads-user-level-vs-kernel-level}


## [Process Scheduling]({{< relref "20211009164312-process_scheduling.md" >}}) are a bunch of algos to control all ways to schedule processes {#process-scheduling--20211009164312-process-scheduling-dot-md--are-a-bunch-of-algos-to-control-all-ways-to-schedule-processes}


### Processes can interfere with each other through concurrent access {#processes-can-interfere-with-each-other-through-concurrent-access}


#### 2 processes can share address spaces (code and data) {#2-processes-can-share-address-spaces--code-and-data}


#### only communicate through files or messages {#only-communicate-through-files-or-messages}


#### We need to processes are executed orderly to be consistent {#we-need-to-processes-are-executed-orderly-to-be-consistent}
