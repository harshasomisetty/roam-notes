### Permutation: testing if every single treatment effect is equal to a specific value (treatment effect for every single unit) {#permutation-testing-if-every-single-treatment-effect-is-equal-to-a-specific-value--treatment-effect-for-every-single-unit}


#### &tau;_i = &tau;\* for all i &isin; {1, ..., n} {#and-tau-i-and-tau-for-all-i-and-isin-1-dot-dot-dot-n}


#### given table, we permute which unit result is actually treatment vs control, then avg those results. we compare the result we got against this permuted distribution, {#given-table-we-permute-which-unit-result-is-actually-treatment-vs-control-then-avg-those-results-dot-we-compare-the-result-we-got-against-this-permuted-distribution}


## For matched pairs, permute treatment within pairs {#for-matched-pairs-permute-treatment-within-pairs}
