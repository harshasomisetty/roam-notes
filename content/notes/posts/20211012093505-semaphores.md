## a non-negative variable that is shared between threads {#a-non-negative-variable-that-is-shared-between-threads}


### accessed only thorugh 2 atomic operatins (wait, signal) {#accessed-only-thorugh-2-atomic-operatins--wait-signal}


#### Wait: makes a process wait until a resource is free (checking S &lt;= 0, which means no resources left). Once positive value (a resource is free), the resource count is decremented and the process goes to critical section {#wait-makes-a-process-wait-until-a-resource-is-free--checking-s-0-which-means-no-resources-left--dot-once-positive-value--a-resource-is-free--the-resource-count-is-decremented-and-the-process-goes-to-critical-section}

<!--list-separator-->

-  P flag, (proberen, to test)


#### Signal: Once process it done with resource, the semphore is incremented {#signal-once-process-it-done-with-resource-the-semphore-is-incremented}

<!--list-separator-->

-  V flag, verhogen to increment


### changes must be indivisible (making sure only one process cna change semaphore at a time) {#changes-must-be-indivisible--making-sure-only-one-process-cna-change-semaphore-at-a-time}


### Types {#types}


#### Mutex Locks: Binary semaphores, they are locks that provide mutual exclusion {#mutex-locks-binary-semaphores-they-are-locks-that-provide-mutual-exclusion}


#### Counting semaphore: Ranging of values to control access to a resource with multiple instances {#counting-semaphore-ranging-of-values-to-control-access-to-a-resource-with-multiple-instances}


## Disadvantages {#disadvantages}


### needs a lot of busy waiting {#needs-a-lot-of-busy-waiting}


#### if one process in critical section, then other process must be stuck in the wait while loop {#if-one-process-in-critical-section-then-other-process-must-be-stuck-in-the-wait-while-loop}


#### This wastes cpu cycles that other processes would have used {#this-wastes-cpu-cycles-that-other-processes-would-have-used}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Spinlock semaphore, a process "spins" while waiting


### Instead, the process can block itself by going into a waiting queue associated with a semaphore, and the process goes into waiting state {#instead-the-process-can-block-itself-by-going-into-a-waiting-queue-associated-with-a-semaphore-and-the-process-goes-into-waiting-state}


#### But this causes _Deadlocks_,  so that in the table below, each process is waiting for a semphore held by the other process, so the processes are stuck indefinetly. {#but-this-causes-deadlocks-so-that-in-the-table-below-each-process-is-waiting-for-a-semphore-held-by-the-other-process-so-the-processes-are-stuck-indefinetly-dot}
