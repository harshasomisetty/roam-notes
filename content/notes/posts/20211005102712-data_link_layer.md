## The logic behind moving a datagram between nodes on same level of a [LAN]({{< relref "20211005103116-lan.md" >}}) {#the-logic-behind-moving-a-datagram-between-nodes-on-same-level-of-a-lan--20211005103116-lan-dot-md}


### Logic behind how data is transferred correctly between computers. {#logic-behind-how-data-is-transferred-correctly-between-computers-dot}


### implemented in hardware on [Network Interface Card]({{< relref "20211207133023-network_interface_card.md" >}}) {#implemented-in-hardware-on-network-interface-card--20211207133023-network-interface-card-dot-md}


## Ethernet is most common layer, defines protocol responsible for data to nodes on the same link {#ethernet-is-most-common-layer-defines-protocol-responsible-for-data-to-nodes-on-the-same-link}


### abstracts away functions for the rest of the layers {#abstracts-away-functions-for-the-rest-of-the-layers}


### Carrier sense multiple acces (CSMA/CD): used to determine when comm channels are clear and you can send data (node can send data if route free, sends in random intervals) {#carrier-sense-multiple-acces--csma-cd--used-to-determine-when-comm-channels-are-clear-and-you-can-send-data--node-can-send-data-if-route-free-sends-in-random-intervals}


#### 1 Persistant, other hots wait until channel is clear, then sends {#1-persistant-other-hots-wait-until-channel-is-clear-then-sends}

<!--list-separator-->

-  However, if two wait at thesame time, then they will collide


#### Non Persistant: wait, then flip random coin to lengthen intervals, low probability of colliding {#non-persistant-wait-then-flip-random-coin-to-lengthen-intervals-low-probability-of-colliding}


#### P Persistant: Non persistant, but transmit with probability p, decreases probability of colliding even more {#p-persistant-non-persistant-but-transmit-with-probability-p-decreases-probability-of-colliding-even-more}


### Ethernet frame: structured info presented in a specific order {#ethernet-frame-structured-info-presented-in-a-specific-order}


#### basically a packet, contains {#basically-a-packet-contains}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Preamble (to syncro data,)

<!--list-separator-->

-  Destination MAC address

<!--list-separator-->

-  Source MAC Address

<!--list-separator-->

-  EtherType field (describe protocol) OR VLAN header (indicatoes virtual lan):

<!--list-separator-->

-  Data Payload (data from higher layers)

<!--list-separator-->

-  FCS (frame check sum to check for data integrity)


### Wireless {#wireless}


#### can't do collision detect in sender, only receiver (send needs to get reflected signal back) {#can-t-do-collision-detect-in-sender-only-receiver--send-needs-to-get-reflected-signal-back}


#### Instead we do collision avoidance (CA): send small tiny contorl packet, if acknowledgement, then send {#instead-we-do-collision-avoidance--ca--send-small-tiny-contorl-packet-if-acknowledgement-then-send}


#### Ad Hoc wireless : becomes wifi sender, for example phone and amazon alexa. then boots into wifi receiver {#ad-hoc-wireless-becomes-wifi-sender-for-example-phone-and-amazon-alexa-dot-then-boots-into-wifi-receiver}


## Broadcast Domain: which ports can communicate. In switch, specific ports can be chosen, hubs, all pors are in broadcast domain {#broadcast-domain-which-ports-can-communicate-dot-in-switch-specific-ports-can-be-chosen-hubs-all-pors-are-in-broadcast-domain}


## Collision domain: which ports can talk at once (calling loss): in switch, only host and client, in hub, all {#collision-domain-which-ports-can-talk-at-once--calling-loss--in-switch-only-host-and-client-in-hub-all}


## Media access control (MAC Address): Unique id attached to a Network interface contorller (NIC), identiifes which node a transmission is intended for {#media-access-control--mac-address--unique-id-attached-to-a-network-interface-contorller--nic--identiifes-which-node-a-transmission-is-intended-for}


### 48 bit, 2 hexadecimal numbers {#48-bit-2-hexadecimal-numbers}


#### globally unique numbers since so many (first three numbers are organizatinall unique indictor, specific to a manufacturer) {#globally-unique-numbers-since-so-many--first-three-numbers-are-organizatinall-unique-indictor-specific-to-a-manufacturer}


### Switch has multiple ports, all connected to a single MAC, switch can easily send data intended for the mac {#switch-has-multiple-ports-all-connected-to-a-single-mac-switch-can-easily-send-data-intended-for-the-mac}


#### MAC Discovery aglorithms {#mac-discovery-aglorithms}


### Shared window, a host cna send out it's data, only inteded reciver picks it up {#shared-window-a-host-cna-send-out-it-s-data-only-inteded-reciver-picks-it-up}


#### But someone else might simultaously send packet, and messages collide {#but-someone-else-might-simultaously-send-packet-and-messages-collide}

Node: Any device that runs a link layer (hosts, routers, swithces, wifi access points)
Links: communicatio path that connect adjacent nodes
