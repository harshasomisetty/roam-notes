## The power of a test is the probability of rejecting a test when it is false {#the-power-of-a-test-is-the-probability-of-rejecting-a-test-when-it-is-false}


### Essentially, the probability of noticing an effect {#essentially-the-probability-of-noticing-an-effect}


#### probability of correctly getting a small p value {#probability-of-correctly-getting-a-small-p-value}


### this is equal to 1 - &beta; (where beta is [Type 2 Error]({{< relref "20211016173402-type_2_error.md" >}})) {#this-is-equal-to-1-and-beta--where-beta-is-type-2-error-20211016173402-type-2-error-dot-md}


#### avoiding type 2 error {#avoiding-type-2-error}


## The power should be atleast .8, and factors include: {#the-power-should-be-atleast-dot-8-and-factors-include}


### alpha level {#alpha-level}


#### higher level of significance, easier to reject test and ergo detect a effect {#higher-level-of-significance-easier-to-reject-test-and-ergo-detect-a-effect}

<!--list-separator-->

-  but, higher change of type 1 error :(


### sample size {#sample-size}


#### larger sample increases power, since the distribution of test statistic is narrowed (les SD) and so its eaiser to tell apart a signficant difference {#larger-sample-increases-power-since-the-distribution-of-test-statistic-is-narrowed--les-sd--and-so-its-eaiser-to-tell-apart-a-signficant-difference}

<!--list-separator-->

-  but, harder and more expensive to get more data


### variance of rv {#variance-of-rv}


#### if RV has more variance, then power decreases, since theres more noise, and can't find a hidden signal {#if-rv-has-more-variance-then-power-decreases-since-theres-more-noise-and-can-t-find-a-hidden-signal}


### Effect size {#effect-size}


#### magnititude of result? like correlatoin coefficient or diff between groups {#magnititude-of-result-like-correlatoin-coefficient-or-diff-between-groups}
