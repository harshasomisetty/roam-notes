## Round Robin {#round-robin}


### processes are delt with in FCS, but processes are constantly preempted, and the FCFS is treated as a circular queue. {#processes-are-delt-with-in-fcs-but-processes-are-constantly-preempted-and-the-fcfs-is-treated-as-a-circular-queue-dot}


#### the scheduler allocated 6the cpu to each process for a small **time quantum** {#the-scheduler-allocated-6the-cpu-to-each-process-for-a-small-time-quantum}


### process can either end, or need to be done again, former cpu just moves on, latter, context switch happens {#process-can-either-end-or-need-to-be-done-again-former-cpu-just-moves-on-latter-context-switch-happens}


#### if quantum is too large, then it will become like FCS, but if too small time quantum, then too many context switches {#if-quantum-is-too-large-then-it-will-become-like-fcs-but-if-too-small-time-quantum-then-too-many-context-switches}
