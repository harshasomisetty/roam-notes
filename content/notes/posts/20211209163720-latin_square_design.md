## Design to account for multiple blocking factors {#design-to-account-for-multiple-blocking-factors}


### Plain latin square is basically orthogonal assignment of treatments, can analyze pretty easily, but low degree of freedom {#plain-latin-square-is-basically-orthogonal-assignment-of-treatments-can-analyze-pretty-easily-but-low-degree-of-freedom}


### but more, you can do replicated latin square {#but-more-you-can-do-replicated-latin-square}


### for more than 3 factors, have greco-latin squares {#for-more-than-3-factors-have-greco-latin-squares}
