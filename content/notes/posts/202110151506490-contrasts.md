## Contrasts allow you to pinpoint which treatments are actually different from each other {#contrasts-allow-you-to-pinpoint-which-treatments-are-actually-different-from-each-other}


## A **Contrast** is a linear  combination of treatment means where the linear combination coefficients add up to 0 {#a-contrast-is-a-linear-combination-of-treatment-means-where-the-linear-combination-coefficients-add-up-to-0}

\\( \sum\_{i=1}^{g} w\_{i} \mu\_{i} = w(\mu\_{i}) \\),  where &sum; w<sub>i</sub> = 0


### Pairwise comparisions {#pairwise-comparisions}


#### contrast the mean response in 2 different treatments {#contrast-the-mean-response-in-2-different-treatments}

<!--list-separator-->

-  with 4 treatments, pick one treatment mean and give it coeff 1, pick another and make it -1. 0 for all others.

<!--list-separator-->

-  for g treatments, there are \\(\frac{g(g-1)}{2}\\) pairwise comparisions


### Control vs other treatments {#control-vs-other-treatments}
