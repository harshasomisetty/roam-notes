## Coantrol variation amount units from other sources {#coantrol-variation-amount-units-from-other-sources}


### can reduce confounding factors {#can-reduce-confounding-factors}


### deals with _nuisance [Factors]({{< relref "20211213012754-factors.md" >}})_ {#deals-with-nuisance-factors--20211213012754-factors-dot-md}


### Design is [Additive Model]({{< relref "20211209163225-additive_model.md" >}}) {#design-is-additive-model--20211209163225-additive-model-dot-md}


## First, we did [Matched Pairs]({{< relref "20211019223446-matched_pairs.md" >}}) {#first-we-did-matched-pairs--20211019223446-matched-pairs-dot-md}


### now, we extend to groups instead of pairs, and the gorup itself is homogenous so can better measure treatments {#now-we-extend-to-groups-instead-of-pairs-and-the-gorup-itself-is-homogenous-so-can-better-measure-treatments}


#### reduce &sigma;^2 {#reduce-and-sigma-2}


## use [Latin Square Design]({{< relref "20211209163720-latin_square_design.md" >}}) for multiple blocks {#use-latin-square-design--20211209163720-latin-square-design-dot-md--for-multiple-blocks}


## When each block doesn't have enough units to assign all treatment levels to, use [Incomplete Block Design]({{< relref "20211221201342-incomplete_block_design.md" >}}) {#when-each-block-doesn-t-have-enough-units-to-assign-all-treatment-levels-to-use-incomplete-block-design--20211221201342-incomplete-block-design-dot-md}


## Calculations {#calculations}


### Now, the sum of squared error of each treatment on a unit vs overall effect is paritioned into differences due to treatment, diff due to blocks, and diff due to error {#now-the-sum-of-squared-error-of-each-treatment-on-a-unit-vs-overall-effect-is-paritioned-into-differences-due-to-treatment-diff-due-to-blocks-and-diff-due-to-error}


### compared to a crd, more of the ss value would be in the block instead of error, giving a more sigificant test statistic {#compared-to-a-crd-more-of-the-ss-value-would-be-in-the-block-instead-of-error-giving-a-more-sigificant-test-statistic}


### CAN'T TEST BLOCK EFFECTS since they were not randomized {#can-t-test-block-effects-since-they-were-not-randomized}
