## Paging, memory is divided into fixed sized units called pages, any free page and be allocated to a process {#paging-memory-is-divided-into-fixed-sized-units-called-pages-any-free-page-and-be-allocated-to-a-process}


### divide physical memory into fixed frames {#divide-physical-memory-into-fixed-frames}


### divide logical memory into blocks called pages {#divide-logical-memory-into-blocks-called-pages}


### keep track of all free frames, for program of size N pages, need N free frame {#keep-track-of-all-free-frames-for-program-of-size-n-pages-need-n-free-frame}


### page table translates logical to physical addresses {#page-table-translates-logical-to-physical-addresses}


## MultiLevel Paging {#multilevel-paging}


### Since page tables themselves can get too big, now theres multilevel paging, where you have a outer table, inner table, then the offset {#since-page-tables-themselves-can-get-too-big-now-theres-multilevel-paging-where-you-have-a-outer-table-inner-table-then-the-offset}

For even bigger tables, we used hashed page tables, where the logical page number is hashed to hash table of linked list,
Also, since os have different page tables for each process, theres too much wasted space. Inverted page tables are a one to one mapping to physical mem, reduced space but increased look up time


## Translational Lookaside Buffer (TLB) {#translational-lookaside-buffer--tlb}

can't just keep table in main memory (needs so muhc time, as we need to access the page table, then the byte)
instead, we use a combination called Translation Look aside buffer
basically caching the recent hits in registers, but keeps the full table in main mem


### virtual memory reference causes 2 look-ups to physical {#virtual-memory-reference-causes-2-look-ups-to-physical}


#### fetch page table entry, then to fetch data {#fetch-page-table-entry-then-to-fetch-data}


#### To speed up, TLD is a cache to quickly get page table entries {#to-speed-up-tld-is-a-cache-to-quickly-get-page-table-entries}
