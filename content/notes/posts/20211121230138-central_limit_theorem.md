## The mean of a sample approaches the true population mean, and variance of the sample  about the mean approaches 0 as the sample size increases {#the-mean-of-a-sample-approaches-the-true-population-mean-and-variance-of-the-sample-about-the-mean-approaches-0-as-the-sample-size-increases}

\begin{align\*}
Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}
\end{align\*}

is the normal distribution

\\(\bar{X}\\) has mean &mu; and var &sigma;^2/n
