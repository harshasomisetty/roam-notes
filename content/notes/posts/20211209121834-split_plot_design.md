## Used when one factor has hard to change levels {#used-when-one-factor-has-hard-to-change-levels}


### To fix, we {#to-fix-we}

experimental units are split plots, and nested within whole plots (which can be nested blocks)

levels of other treatment factors are assigned to whole plots and remain constant (these factors have hard to change levels)

Each replicate/block is divided into parts (whole plots), and each whole plot is divided into sub sections called split plots.


## Complicating designs {#complicating-designs}


### Can have factorial structure in whole plots or split plots (2 whole plots, 2 split plots) {#can-have-factorial-structure-in-whole-plots-or-split-plots--2-whole-plots-2-split-plots}


#### useful if 1 hard to change factor and other easy to change {#useful-if-1-hard-to-change-factor-and-other-easy-to-change}


### Split plot with blocking {#split-plot-with-blocking}


#### usually block on whole plots {#usually-block-on-whole-plots}


## Split-split plot {#split-split-plot}


### useful for 1 very hard to change, 1 somewhat hard to change factors {#useful-for-1-very-hard-to-change-1-somewhat-hard-to-change-factors}


## Strip Plot {#strip-plot}


### 2 hard to change factors {#2-hard-to-change-factors}
