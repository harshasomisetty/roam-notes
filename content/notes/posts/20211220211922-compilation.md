source program-
addresses are symbolic

compile itme - code being processed by compiler (code to executable binary)
addresses are relocatable (14 bytes from the beginning of this module)

load time - reading executable from storage intomain mem (initial memory alloc is being reserved and inited)
absolute addresse

execution time - when program is in main mem and is running

if we know at compile time where process will reside, then absolute code can be genned
if starting location changes though, we need to recompile code to regen the data location

if we don't know at compile time where process will reside, then compiler must gen relocatiable code
(the final binding is delyated until load time)

if a process can be moved during execution from one memory loc to another, then binding must be delayed until run time

dyanmic linking and loading

in dyanmic loading, system libraries are just stored in main memory, so that each rogram doesn't have its own copy and waste space

**stubs** are included in the image? of each reference which tells the code where to access the data for the library in main memory
