## Routing {#routing}


### router is a network device that forwards traffic depending on the destination address of that traffic {#router-is-a-network-device-that-forwards-traffic-depending-on-the-destination-address-of-that-traffic}


#### connected to 2 networks to get and send data {#connected-to-2-networks-to-get-and-send-data}


### Steps {#steps}


#### Receive data packet {#receive-data-packet}


#### examine destination ip {#examine-destination-ip}


#### looks up ip in routing table {#looks-up-ip-in-routing-table}


#### forwards packet to destination {#forwards-packet-to-destination}


### Routing Table {#routing-table}


#### row for desination addresses {#row-for-desination-addresses}


#### Next Hop {#next-hop}

### Non routable address space: core routers will never route to thise addresses, so anyone can use these (can be used in autonomous organizations) {#non-routable-address-space-core-routers-will-never-route-to-thise-addresses-so-anyone-can-use-these--can-be-used-in-autonomous-organizations}

### gne 1: Router literally copies packet data into buffer, does looop up, then into otugoing port {#gne-1-router-literally-copies-packet-data-into-buffer-does-looop-up-then-into-otugoing-port}


#### speed is literally bound by I/O Bus {#speed-is-literally-bound-by-i-o-bus}


#### memeory copy also slow {#memeory-copy-also-slow}


### Gen 2: there are small caches in each port (linecard), if there is a cache hit, then actual memory isn't needed {#gen-2-there-are-small-caches-in-each-port--linecard--if-there-is-a-cache-hit-then-actual-memory-isn-t-needed}
