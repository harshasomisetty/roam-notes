## Matched pairs design {#matched-pairs-design}


### can decrease error by making sure units groups for treatment and contorl are somewhat similar (on average treatment makes more sense now) {#can-decrease-error-by-making-sure-units-groups-for-treatment-and-contorl-are-somewhat-similar--on-average-treatment-makes-more-sense-now}


### normaly, rnadomization lets use cmpare treamtent effects on avg, but if we do a proper matched pares, we can compare actual treatment effects {#normaly-rnadomization-lets-use-cmpare-treamtent-effects-on-avg-but-if-we-do-a-proper-matched-pares-we-can-compare-actual-treatment-effects}
