## Basic componenet of CPU Utilization {#basic-componenet-of-cpu-utilization}


### "A path of execution in a process", and a process can have multiple threads {#a-path-of-execution-in-a-process-and-a-process-can-have-multiple-threads}


### Has a thread id, program coutner, register set, a stack {#has-a-thread-id-program-coutner-register-set-a-stack}


### [Multithreading]({{< relref "20211014224011-multithreading.md" >}}) can parallelize work {#multithreading--20211014224011-multithreading-dot-md--can-parallelize-work}


## VS Process {#vs-process}


### Process's threads have shared memeory and files, but each has own counter and registers and stack {#process-s-threads-have-shared-memeory-and-files-but-each-has-own-counter-and-registers-and-stack}


### very response, and faster context swtiching because shared memeory {#very-response-and-faster-context-swtiching-because-shared-memeory}


### and use a multiprocessor system {#and-use-a-multiprocessor-system}


## Kernal vs User threads {#kernal-vs-user-threads}


### User {#user}


#### easy to create threads since many registers and fast context switching {#easy-to-create-threads-since-many-registers-and-fast-context-switching}


#### changes at application level {#changes-at-application-level}


### Kernal {#kernal}


#### independent of a process, more expensive to create and manage and context swtich {#independent-of-a-process-more-expensive-to-create-and-manage-and-context-swtich}


## Thread Cancelation {#thread-cancelation}


### terminating a thread when it is not fully finished {#terminating-a-thread-when-it-is-not-fully-finished}


#### If multiple threads are searching a database, but one thread finds the value and returns, then the rest of the threads can cancel {#if-multiple-threads-are-searching-a-database-but-one-thread-finds-the-value-and-returns-then-the-rest-of-the-threads-can-cancel}


#### stop loading a webpage as it is loading. then all the current threads just stop {#stop-loading-a-webpage-as-it-is-loading-dot-then-all-the-current-threads-just-stop}


#### Asynchronous cancellation: One thread cancles the target thread {#asynchronous-cancellation-one-thread-cancles-the-target-thread}


#### Deffered Cancellatioin: Target thread checks if it should terminate itself {#deffered-cancellatioin-target-thread-checks-if-it-should-terminate-itself}


### Difficulties {#difficulties}


#### resources are not restored when async canceled, and less reousrces to use in genreal {#resources-are-not-restored-when-async-canceled-and-less-reousrces-to-use-in-genreal}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Deffering cancellation will make it so that a thread only cancels when its safe


## Thread Synchronization {#thread-synchronization}


### need to manage data between threads, but we encounter a couple problems {#need-to-manage-data-between-threads-but-we-encounter-a-couple-problems}


### [Thread Concurrency]({{< relref "20211010190335-thread_concurrency.md" >}}) {#thread-concurrency--20211010190335-thread-concurrency-dot-md}
